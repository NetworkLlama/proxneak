A means of exfiltrating data through anything that allows a connection, including regenerative proxies.

Requires pcapy on the receiving side.

Thanks to:
  Silver Moon for his pcapy code
  Lelouch Lamperouge for some inspiration on bits-to-bytes conversion
  Stephen Sims for getting me started on Python through a grueling SANS SEC660 course
  Catherine for putting up with me while I'm coding
